## Comparison: SOC2 vs ISO 27001

| Aspect | SOC2 Type II | ISO 27001 |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **Origin** | USA (AICPA) | International (ISO) |
| **Focus** | Service provider controls | ISMS for any organization |
| **Prescriptive** | Principles-based | Risk-based |
| **Audit** | Third-party CPA | Accredited certification body |
| **Duration** | 3-12 months observation | 12-18 months implementation |
| **Report** | Private (shared with clients) | Public certificate |
| **Cost** | $35K-$150K | $50K-$250K |
| **Renewal** | Annual | 3 years (with annual surveillance) |
| **Best for** | SaaS, cloud services | Any industry, global recognition |

## Combined Approach

Many organizations pursue both certifications:

1. **Start with SOC2** (faster, US market focused)
2. **Leverage SOC2 work for ISO 27001** (overlap ~60%)
3. **Add ISO 27001** (global markets, stronger brand)

### Shared Controls
- Access control
- Encryption
- Audit logging
- Incident response
- Business continuity
- Vendor management
- Security training

### Additional for ISO 27001
- Formal ISMS with management commitment
- Risk assessment methodology
- Statement of Applicability
- Internal audit program
- Continual improvement process
